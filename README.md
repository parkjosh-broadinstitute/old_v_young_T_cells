Analysis of old vs young CD4 T cells in mice

This repository contains code for reproducing analyses and figures of the scRNA-seq data in Zhivaki et al. [Correction of age-associated defects in dendritic cell enables CD4 + T cells to eradicate tumors in the elderly](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742400535X?dgcid=coauthor)

This is a standard scRNA-seq workflow done in the Scanpy framework. The notebooks cover generation of figures 2 and S2.
The raw gene count matrix is in [GEO 260791](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE260791)
